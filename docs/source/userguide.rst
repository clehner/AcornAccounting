Something goes here _eventually_.


Maybe something like:

#. Configuration
#. Your First 5 Minutes
#. Headers
#. Accounts
#. Events
#. Entrys
#. Fiscal Years
#. Reports

Each section should talk about creating, editing and viewing details.
Maybe sections for various pages:

#. The Bank Register
#. The General Ledger
#. The Chart of Accounts

This is very low priority


Tips
-----

While the user guide is incomplete, this will be a list of specific important
tips all users should know:

* No dates need leading zeros. `1/5/15` is the same as `01/05/2015`.
