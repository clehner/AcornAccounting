User Guide
==================

Something goes here _eventually_.


Maybe something like:

#. Configuration
#. Your First 5 Minutes
#. Headers
#. Accounts
#. Events
#. Entrys
#. Fiscal Years
#. Reports

Each section should talk about creating, editing and viewing details.
Maybe sections for various pages:

#. The Bank Register
#. The General Ledger
#. The Chart of Accounts

This is very low priority


Tips
-----

While the user guide is incomplete, this list will exist for important tips
that maybe not be immediately obvious:

* No dates require leading zeros. `1/5/15` is the same as `01/05/2015`.
* For Bank Spending & Receiving Entries, you can leave the memo blank & it will
  be automatically filled with the first Account you select.
