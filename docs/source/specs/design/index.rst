Design Specifications describe the interface between the User and the
Application, how the User interacts with the Application and how the Application
responds.

AcornAccounting is expected to be used by at least 3 different types of
people:

#. Communards - People interested in checking balances and project budgets
#. Accountants - People responsible for entering in new data
#. Budgeters - People responsible for analyzing the data for planning and
   external uses

:ref:`Use Cases` lists every activity that each of these people are expected to
perform. :ref:`Screen Descriptions <Screen Designs>` describes how the application
allows the actor to perform the activities. Included in the Descriptions are
the :ref:`Screen's Conditions <Conditions Explanation>`, which describe the
expected usage of each Screen.

The :ref:`Future Features` section contains the planning and design information
